# Stoma3D-YOLOv8

**3D Stomatal Detection and Quantification Using YOLOv8 and qDPC Microscopy** 
This repository hosts the full pipeline for **automated 3D stomatal trait analysis**, developed as part of the MSc thesis project: **"AI quantification for optimising plant water use and global food security"** by **Shen Liu**, University of Nottingham, 2025.

## Overview

**Stoma3D-YOLOv8** integrates high-resolution **qDPC microscopy**, **UV-resin surface replication**, and **deep learning models (YOLOv8)** to detect and quantify **plant stomatal features** in 3D. The project addresses limitations in conventional stomatal phenotyping by providing a **non-invasive, scalable, and AI-driven solution** for measuring key traits used in **Water-Use Efficiency (GS MAX)** estimation.
